Greetings:
#
Here you will find the files in ".xlsx" format, which contain the datasets used for the network analysis by occupation period.
#
These files were initially written in an Excel® database in its 2010 version.
#
The file names are in Spanish, so that, for example, the files with the letters “Tipos” are translated into English as ceramic types, 
while “Desgrasantes” are translated into English as mineral tempers
